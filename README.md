# Fermionic linear optics simulations of the surface code

This GitHub repository contains two codes.

1. FLO_coherent_readout.py simulates the effect of simultaneous coherent and redout errors. This code has been used to generate the numerics for the paper
[Coherent errors and readout errors in the surface code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04672).

2. FLO_Kitaev_lattice_mld.py simulates the effect of coherent errors in the surface code on the original Kitaev lattice. It also contains an efficent
   maximum likelihood decoder.
